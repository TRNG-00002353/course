### Question 61
**[Linux]**

What does the command `chmod 755 script.sh` do?

A) Changes the owner of the file
B) Sets read, write, execute for owner; read, execute for group and others
C) Deletes the file permissions
D) Sets read-only permissions for everyone

**Correct Answer: B) Sets read, write, execute for owner; read, execute for group and others**

**Explanation:** In octal notation, 7 = rwx (read+write+execute), 5 = r-x (read+execute). So 755 means owner gets full permissions, while group and others get read and execute permissions.

**Why other options are incorrect:**
- **A) Changes the owner of the file** - Changing ownership requires the `chown` command, not `chmod`.
- **C) Deletes the file permissions** - `chmod` modifies permissions; it doesn't delete them. To remove all permissions, you would use `chmod 000`.
- **D) Sets read-only permissions for everyone** - Read-only for everyone would be `444`, not `755`.

C) Powers of 2 (2, 4, 8, 16...)
D) Multiples of 10

**Correct Answer: B) Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13...)**

**Explanation:** The Fibonacci sequence reflects increasing uncertainty in larger estimates, with gaps getting bigger as complexity grows.

**Why other options are incorrect:**
- **A) 1, 2, 3, 4, 5** - Linear sequences don't reflect the increased uncertainty in larger items.
- **C) Powers of 2 (2, 4, 8, 16...)** - Some teams use this, but Fibonacci is more common.
- **D) Multiples of 10** - This is too coarse for meaningful relative estimation.

A) Redirect output to a file
B) Run commands in the background
C) Pass output of one command as input to another
D) Concatenate files

**Correct Answer: C) Pass output of one command as input to another**

**Explanation:** The pipe operator takes the standard output of the command on its left and sends it as standard input to the command on its right, enabling command chaining.

**Why other options are incorrect:**
- **A) Redirect output to a file** - File redirection uses `>` or `>>`, not the pipe.
- **B) Run commands in the background** - Running commands in background uses `&` at the end of the command.
- **D) Concatenate files** - File concatenation is done with the `cat` command, not the pipe operator.

**Correct Answer: B) Includes padding and border in the element's total width/height**

**Explanation:** With `border-box`, the element's width/height includes content, padding, and border, making sizing more predictable.

**Why other options are incorrect:**
- **A) Adds a border to all elements** - This only changes how sizing is calculated.
- **C) Removes the box model** - The box model still exists; sizing behavior changes.
- **D) Creates a shadow effect** - Shadows use `box-shadow`, not `box-sizing`.

**Why other options are incorrect:**
- **A) Creates a new empty repository** - Empty repositories are created with `git init`.
- **C) Merges two branches** - Branch merging is done with `git merge`.
- **D) Creates a backup of local repository** - While it can serve as backup, clone specifically copies from remote to local.

D) "Feature: [name], Priority: [level]"

**Correct Answer: B) "As a [user], I want [feature], so that [benefit]"**

**Explanation:** This format captures who needs the feature, what they need, and why, ensuring clarity on user value.

**Why other options are incorrect:**
- **A) "The system shall..."** - This is traditional requirements language, not user story format.
- **C) "If [condition], then [result]"** - This resembles acceptance criteria or test conditions.
- **D) "Feature: [name], Priority: [level]"** - This is metadata, not the story format itself.

**[Git]**

What is the purpose of `.gitignore` file?

A) To store Git configuration
B) To specify files that Git should not track

D) To define branch names

**Correct Answer: B) To specify files that Git should not track**

**Explanation:** The `.gitignore` file tells Git which files or directories to ignore, preventing them from being tracked or committed (e.g., node_modules, build files).

**Why other options are incorrect:**
- **A) To store Git configuration** - Git config is stored in `.git/config` or `~/.gitconfig`.
- **C) To list commit messages** - Commit messages are in the Git log, not .gitignore.

### Question 112
**[Git]**

Which pattern in `.gitignore` ignores all `.log` files?

A) `*.log`
B) `log.*`
C) `.log`
D) `all.log`

**Correct Answer: A) `*.log`**

**Explanation:** The `*` is a wildcard matching any characters, so `*.log` matches all files ending with the `.log` extension.

**Why other options are incorrect:**
- **B) `log.*`** - This matches files starting with "log." like `log.txt`, not ending with `.log`.
- **C) `.log`** - This would match only a file literally named `.log`, not all log files.
- **D) `all.log`** - This matches only a file named exactly `all.log`.

What does the command `cat file1.txt file2.txt > combined.txt` do?

A) Compares two files
B) Concatenates two files and saves to a new file
C) Moves files to a new location
D) Creates a backup of files

**Correct Answer: B) Concatenates two files and saves to a new file**

**Explanation:** The `cat` command concatenates the contents of file1.txt and file2.txt, and the `>` redirects the combined output to combined.txt.

**Why other options are incorrect:**
- **A) Compares two files** - File comparison is done with `diff` or `cmp` commands, not `cat`.
- **C) Moves files to a new location** - Moving files requires the `mv` command.
- **D) Creates a backup of files** - This creates a new file with combined content, not a backup mechanism.

**Why other options are incorrect:**
- **A) `top`** - This is correct but not the only answer; it shows real-time process information.

**Explanation:** Git tracks files in three states: Modified (changed but not staged), Staged (marked for next commit), and Committed (safely stored in the local database).

**Why other options are incorrect:**
- **A) Created, Updated, Deleted** - These describe file operations, not Git's tracking states.
- **C) Local, Remote, Cloud** - These describe repository locations, not file states.
- **D) Draft, Review, Final** - These are not Git concepts; they might describe workflow stages.
